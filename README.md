## Repo structure
### Lessons (in the README file)
Lessons will usually contain:
- Resources covering the specified topic
- Extra notes (either videos or text) on points not covered by the resources
- Problems

#### Problem categories
Problems will usually be divided to:
- Basic problems: These are the problems that you should not skip. If you struggle with a basic problem, go read the solution to get the idea, then implement the solution on your own.
- Extra problems: These are usually harder problems. Feel free to skip these and get back to them later when you finish the training if you need more practice on a certain topic.
- Refresh problems: These problems are not related to the topic covered by the lesson, they will usually be
    - Problems on older topics
    - Ad-hock or greedy problems

Problems are **sorted** according to difficulty.

### Material
I will put the source code used in the videos that I record there.

### Solutions
This directory contains **documented solutions** for the training problems. If the solution isn't straightforward, you will find an explanation above the main function.

It is **highly recommended** that you read through the solutions even if you solve the problem, as you may find useful tricks there!

### Problems
As this is an extremely important topic that frequently appears on programming contests, please solve all the following problems:
- [a2oj contest]
- A2OJ doesn't support Codility. Solve the first 3 problems in A2OJ's contest above, then solve these following problems on Codility before continuing
    - https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/10-prime_and_composite_numbers/count_factors/ (very easy)
    - https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/10-prime_and_composite_numbers/min_perimeter_rectangle/ (very easy)
    - https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/11-sieve_of_eratosthenes/count_semiprimes/
    - https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/11-sieve_of_eratosthenes/count_non_divisible/

**Extra**  
If the above problems were easy for you and you want to go fancier, read this [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segmented-sieve/) about Segment Sieve, then give the following problems a try:
1. [SPOJ PRIME1](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PRIME1/)
2. [UVA 294](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=230)
