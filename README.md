# About
## Prerequisites
The basics covered in this training:  
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYknlDiw2kSwdDhTSDoX7ZoVEle8nbZdk

## Repo structure
### Lessons (in the README file)
Lessons will usually contain:
- Resources covering the specified topic
- Extra notes (either videos or text) on points not covered by the resources
- Problems

#### Problem categories
Problems will usually be divided to:
- Basic problems: These are the problems that you should not skip. If you struggle with a basic problem, go read the solution to get the idea, then implement the solution on your own.
- Extra problems: These are usually harder problems. Feel free to skip these and get back to them later when you finish the training if you need more practice on a certain topic.
- Refresh problems: These problems are not related to the topic covered by the lesson, they will usually be
    - Problems on older topics
    - Ad-hock or greedy problems

Problems are **sorted** according to difficulty.

### Material
I will put the source code used in the videos that I record there.

### Solutions
This directory contains **documented solutions** for the training problems. If the solution isn't straightforward, you will find an explanation above the main function.

It is **highly recommended** that you read through the solutions even if you solve the problem, as you may find useful tricks there!
