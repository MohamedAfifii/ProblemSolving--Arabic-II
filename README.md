# About
## Prerequisites
The basics covered in this training:  
https://github.com/MohamedAfifii/ProblemSolving--Arabic

## Repo structure
### Lessons (in the README file)
Lessons will usually contain:
- Resources covering the specified topic
- Extra notes (either videos or text) on points not covered by the resources
- Problems

#### Problem categories
Problems will usually be divided to:
- Basic problems: These are the problems that you should not skip. If you struggle with a basic problem, go read the solution to get the idea, then implement the solution on your own.
- Extra problems: These are usually harder problems. Feel free to skip these and get back to them later when you finish the training if you need more practice on a certain topic.
- Refresh problems: These problems are not related to the topic covered by the lesson, they will usually be
    - Problems on older topics
    - Ad-hock or greedy problems

Problems are **sorted** according to difficulty.

### Material
I will put the source code used in the videos that I record there.

### Solutions
This directory contains **documented solutions** for the training problems. If the solution isn't straightforward, you will find an explanation above the main function.

It is **highly recommended** that you read through the solutions even if you solve the problem, as you may find useful tricks there!

# Lessons
## 1. Number Theory: Factorization and Sieve of Eratosthenes

### Resources
Read these two short PDFs:
- [x] https://codility.com/media/train/8-PrimeNumbers.pdf
- [ ] https://codility.com/media/train/9-Sieve.pdf

Watch these two videos by Mustafa Saad:
- [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZBfW08ECgA
- [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5ApOQDhBtU

Watch this video that highlights important points that were not highlighted by the resources above:  
- [ ] https://youtu.be/xUk2SggGDRc

### Notes
The code in the last video can be easily modified to generate all the divisors (not only the prime divisors) for all numbers from 1 to N.
```CPP
int n = 10;
vector<vector<int>> divisors(n+1);

//i starts from 1
//All numbers (not only prime numbers) will visit their multiples
for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)    
{
    for(int j = i; j <= n; j += i)
    {
        divisors[j].push_back(i);
    }
}
```
The complexity of this algorithm is `O(NlogN)` (assuming that `push_back` is `O(1)` for simplicity). The proof is similar to the proof mentioned in [Codility's PDF](https://codility.com/media/train/9-Sieve.pdf), except that the summation is now over all numbers from 1 to N. See this interesting [derivation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25905118/finding-big-o-of-the-harmonic-series) if you want to know why the upper bound for the summation is indeed `O(logN)` (**feel free to skip the proof**).
